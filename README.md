This Kata has been written in C language for performing the addition and subtraction of
Roman numerals.
It also validates invalid roman numerals like abc, IIII and null.
My solution was to convert a roman to arabic, perform the mathematical calculations and
then convert back the result.

Make file:
---------
run "make clean" to delete all the generated files
run "make test" to run all the tests (Both the suites: converter and calculator)
